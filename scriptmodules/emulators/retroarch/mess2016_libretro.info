description = "Based on a snapshot of the MAME codebase circa 2016, 'MAME 2016' is compatible with MAME 0.174 ROM sets. MAME is the most compatible emulator in the world, and it can run almost any game from any platform (though running console games through this core requires additional steps). If your device can run the up-to-date MAME - Current core at full speed, most users will have a better experience with that core, while FBNeo is typically a better choice for speed vs accuracy, as long as it supports the game(s) in question. Otherwise, this core is notable as the most recent snapshot core with an unchanging ROM set."
