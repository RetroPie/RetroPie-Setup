description = "'MAME - Current' is compatible with the latest MAME ROM sets. MAME is the most compatible emulator in the world. This core includes the MESS portion of the emulator. MAME's high compatibility makes it a good option for most users looking to play arcade games. If you cannot run this core full speed, the year-stamped forks are faster at the cost of reduced accuracy"
