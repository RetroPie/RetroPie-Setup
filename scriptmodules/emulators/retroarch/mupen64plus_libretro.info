description = "The legacy version of the Mupen64Plus N64 emulator, ported to libretro. It uses the GLideN64 plugin as its default graphics plug, though the high-accuracy Angrylion and ParaLLEl-RDP plugins are also available. This core is no longer developed, but it's still useful for low power devices - for other platforms use the Mupen64Plus-Next core"
