USER-EDITABLE VARIABLES (located at the top of the respective files):
Each of the gaussian blur shaders have a 'blurfactor' variable that can increase or decrease the intensity of the blurring effect.
They also have a 'wid' variable that effectively controls the brightness of the image. At lower resolutions, the shader can get quite dark, so you 
can raise this value to compensate.

The 'phosphorlut-pass2' shader has a variable, 'brightness,' which can also increase the brightness some if the image is too dark.

If you are already getting gamma correction from somewhere else (such as another shader or filter), you can comment out (i.e., put two slashes in
front of it, like this: //) the image-adjustment.glsl shader below and change the 'shaders' line to 4 instead of 5 to remove it.
