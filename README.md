RetroPie-Setup
==============

General Usage
-------------

Shell script to setup the Raspberry Pi 1 / 2 with several emulators, various cores, and EmulationStation as graphical front end. Bootable pre-made images are available from http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/ for those that want a ready to go system.

This script is designed for use on the Raspbian Wheezy distribution. It has some support for Raspbian Jessie / OSMC but requires building from source - and there may be problems with modules. Before using the script, please **make sure that you have run the raspi-config script to extend your root file system **. You can run the script with

```shell
sudo raspi-config
```

To run the RetroPie Setup Script make sure that your APT repositories are up-to-date and that Git is installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git
```

Then you can download the latest RetroPie setup script with

```shell
cd
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.git
```

The script is executed with 

```shell
cd RetroPie-Setup
sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
```

When you first run the script it may install some additional packages that are needed. Note that you might **need to reboot your Raspberry**, if your firmware was updated during the installation process.


Binaries and Sources
--------------------

RetroPie Setup offers the possibility to install from binaries or build from source. For most users installing from binary should suffice - but for the very latest versions of some software building from source may be preferred. Building from source can take more than a day on a Raspberry Pi.
