RetroPie-Setup
==============

General Usage
-------------

Shell script to setup the Raspberry Pi, Vero4K, ODroid-C1 or a PC running Ubuntu with many emulators and games, using EmulationStation as the graphical front end. Bootable pre-made images for the Raspberry Pi are available for those that want a ready-to-go system, downloadable from the releases section of GitHub or via our website at https://retropie.org.uk.

This script is designed for use on Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) on the Raspberry Pi, OSMC on the Vero4K or Ubuntu on the ODroid-C1 or a PC.

To run the RetroPie Setup Script make sure that your APT repositories are up-to-date and that Git is installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install git
```

Then you can download the latest RetroPie setup script with:

```shell
cd
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.git
```

The script is executed with:

```shell
cd RetroPie-Setup
./retropie_setup.sh
```
Note: the script is running as root by default.

When you first run the script it may install some additional packages that are needed.

Binaries and Sources
--------------------

On the Raspberry Pi, RetroPie Setup offers the possibility to install from binaries or source. For other supported platforms only a source install is available. Installing from binary is recommended on a Raspberry Pi as building everything from source can take a long time.
